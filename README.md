# WeatherStation
  Weather station is based on Atmega8 microcontroller and used such sensors:
  - BMP180 (atmospheric pressure);
  - DS18B20 (indoor temperature);
  - DS18B20 (outdoor temperature);
  - DHT11 (indoor humidity).
  
  The information displays on 2x8 text LCD (HD44780).
  
  I would like to express my deep gratitude to Davide Gironi (http://davidegironi.blogspot.com/) 
  for the provided libraries for working with BMP180 and DHT11 sensors.
